 <h2> 1.Testimonial</h2> <br>
  Using useState I'm changing between the cards by calling a function <br>
  The testimonials are stored in an array of objects (data.js), each object represents a card with its own name, photo, description and designation.<br>

 <h2> 2. Password Generator</h2><br>
 This is a simple password generator that generates random alphanumeric characters and special symbols.<br>
 The generated password length can be set by the user between 1 to 30 and default value will be 8<br> 
 And it will generate a new password every time when user cicks on length/ numers/ special character<br>
